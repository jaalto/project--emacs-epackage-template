There is no automatic install target in Makefile

These files are provided to help with creating epacakges.

1. Add current directory to your PATH in order to access get.sh that
   can read epackage/info for URLs how to retrive upstream updates.

2. Source the provided shell startup file to get access to helper
   functions. They assist in creating and dealing with epacakges.

       # Somewhere in your ~/.bashrc ....

       # The variable name has to be exactly like this.
       # The shell funtions refer to it.
       . <path to this directory>/epackage.shellrc

   See what functions are available (you MUST read README*)
   after you have sourced the epackage.shellrc:

       Ehelp

3. Point environment variable to the actual epacakge.el directory that
   will do the actual work. The shell helper functions are only
   front-ends to it.

       git clone git@github.com:jaalto/project--emacs-epackage.git

       # Add to ~/.bashrc
       export EPACKAGE_ROOT=<path to>/project--emacs-epackage

See README* for more information how to make and maintain distributed
Emacs Lisp Packages (DELPS) with Git.
